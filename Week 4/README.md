# Variables
What is a variable?

# var and let and const

There are two ways of declaring a variable in Javascript 

var - The old way of declaring a variable in JS.

var number = 5 

let - The modern way of declaring a variable in JS. Defines a variable with a restricted scope - not supported in older browsers 

let number = 5

const - A declaration for a variable's value that reassigned after it is declared - A value that is always the same

const example

const pi = 3.14159

# Variable declaration

# Data types
A data type is a type of data that we assign to variables

# String
String is a data type used to represent text characters

example 

let name = "Emmanuel"

# Number
Number is a data type that we use to represent numbers
Can represent up to 2^53 - 2^53-1 = 9,007,199,254,740,992 to -9,007,199,254,740,992

# BigInt
BigInt is a data type that we can use to represent numbers that are larger than the range that the Number data type can represent 
We can declare a number as a BigInt by adding n to the end of the number

let number = 13142144212441n

# Boolean
Boolean is a data type that has two values true and false, we use boolean values to represent yes and no values 

let age = 22
let isOlderThan18 = true

# Null

# Undefined
Undefined refers to a variable that hasn't been assigned a value

let name;

alert(name) - Will print undefined
