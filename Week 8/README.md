# What is debugging?
Debugging is the process of finding and resolving bugs within programs. Programs that aid us with debugging are known as debuggers

# Live Server
Live Server is a VS Code extension that allows us to run a local development server with live reload for our html pages - so whenever we make a change to our page and save it, the change will be reflected on the live server version of the page (Saves us the hassle of having to reload our page each and everytime we make a change to it).

# Setting up Live Server
To set up Live Server we need to go to the Extension page

- The fourth button on the left hand side of VS Code's toolbar 

The other way we can get to extensions is by going to view on the top window bar of VS code and then going to extensions

![liveserver-image2](https://github.com/emarkexe2001/Web-Development-Course/blob/main/Week%208/Screenshots/Screenshot%20(17).png?raw=true)

From there, on the search bar for Extension type in Live Server
![liveserver-image3](https://github.com/emarkexe2001/Web-Development-Course/blob/main/Week%208/Screenshots/Live%20server%20img%203.png?raw=true)

The first option that appears on the results should be Live Server. Click on it, there is a button for you to install it (This screenshot replaces the install button with an uninstall button as I already have Live Server installed).

# Using Live Server

To run Live Server once we have installed it all we need to do is click on the html page in our folder that we want to run and press open with Live Server

![liveserver-image5](https://github.com/emarkexe2001/Web-Development-Course/blob/main/Week%208/Screenshots/Live%20Server%20(Running%201).png?raw=true)

This will run our page with live server
![liveserver-image5](https://github.com/emarkexe2001/Web-Development-Course/blob/main/Week%208/Screenshots/Web%20page%20with%20Live%20Server.png?raw=true)

Now if we were to make a change to our html and save it
![liveserver-image5](https://github.com/emarkexe2001/Web-Development-Course/blob/main/Week%208/Screenshots/Live%20Server%20usage%202.png?raw=true)

and reload the page

![liveserver-image5](https://github.com/emarkexe2001/Web-Development-Course/blob/main/Week%208/Screenshots/Web%20page%20with%20Live%20Server%20(2).png?raw=true)

As you can see Live server has reloaded the page for us to reflect the change made to our html
