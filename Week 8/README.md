# Live Server
Live Server is a VS Code extension that allows us to run a local development server with live reload for our html pages - so whenever we make a change to our page and save it, the change will be reflected on the live server version of the page (Saves us the hassle of having to reload our page each and everytime we make a change to it).

# Setting up Live Server
To set up Live Server we need to go to the Extension page

- The button after the run button in VS Code. In the search bar type Live Server, it should pop up as the first option, click on it and click on the install button.
