# Week 9 - Function Expressions and Arrow Functions

# What is a function declaraiton?
A function declaration is a syntax for creating a function by creating a block of code.

```JS
function myFunction()
{
    document.getElementById("jsElement").innerHTML = "This paragraph is written in JavaScript";
}
```
We can also create a function using another type of syntax for creating a function known as Function Expression.

# What is a function expression?

Another syntax for creating a function. We create a function in Function expression by assigning the function valve and storing it in a variable. (The assignment of the function value is explicit)

Unlike function declaration when create a function using function expression we need a semicolon as setting the variable value as a function is treated as an assignment.

# Callback functions

A callback function is a function or one or more functions that we pass into another function expecting to "call them back" later when we need them.

We can create a callback function using both Function Declaration and Function Expression.

Function Declaration example here:

Function Expression example here:

# Arrow functions
An arrow function is another function syntax for creating functions.

Example:

Second Example:

Is the same as a function expression but more of a shorthand version of it

Function Expression version

# Multiline arrow functions

We can also assign arrow functions using curly braces these are known as Multiline arrow functions

Example:
