# Homework Review

Review of last week's homework - Going through the bootstrap tutorial and creating a table using bootstrap with a required address line formatted using line break tags.

# Input fields
- Up till now we have been working hard coded data

- data that we declare and create in our program but websites work with data that is provided from the user in this case our input fields will act as a method for our users to enter data that we can use.

Think for example - when you register for an account on a website or login to a website

```html
<body>
      <form>
          <div class="form-group">
              <label for="exampleInputEmail">Email address</label>
              <input type="email" class="form-control" id="exampleInputEmail" aria-describedby="emailHelp" placeholder="Enter email">
              <small id="emailHelp" class="form-text text-muted">Share your email with us</small>
          </div>
          <div class="form-group">
              <label for="exampleInputPassword">Password</label>
              <input type="password" class="form-control" id="exampleInputPassword" placeholder="Password">
          </div>
      </form>
  </body>
```

# Buttons

We can also add a button to our form - Buttons can handle an event when we click on them but for now we will just have a button that doesn't do anything when pressed.

# Checkboxes

# Dropdown selection

# Multiple selection

# Radio buttons

# Homework - Go through the Bootstrap tutorial for forms and create a form page - For now don't worry about page functionality we will expand on that later on
