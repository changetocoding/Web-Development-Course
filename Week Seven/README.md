# Github 

# What is GitHub
Github is a website that allows to upload code to a repository, Once that code has been uploaded, it can be kept track of, managed, accessed and updated by other users. 

Allowing others to collabrate on projects together, big or small, this becomes really important when working on a code project with two or more members where it becomes easier to track and know what changes have been made to the project, by who and when they were made.

# What is Version Control
Version Control is software tools that help a software team manage changes made to source code over time, Version control software keeps track of any changes made to the source code each time a change is made. So when a mistake is made the code can be reverted back to a previous version or the previous versions of the code can be checked to see where the problem is coming from.

# What is Git
Git is a source control tool that allows developers to share code, back up code and track changes made to code.

# Creating a Repository 
To create a repository in github, go to the home page of your github account. On the left side there is a repositories tab, press the green button on the right hand side. Enter the repository name, you can enter a description but aren't required to but I would recommend adding a description, set the repository to public or private. Choose if you want to add a README file, .gitignore and a license (not required), Once done press the create repository button to create a new repository.

# Creating a local git repository 
To create a local repository in git, First we need to create a folder in the directory where we want our repository to be, we can do this by doing the following

cd ~/Desktop
mkdir myproject
cd myproject 

cd - will move to the directory 
mkdir - will create a directory in the target directory

Then run the git init command to create a git repository in the root of the folder

myproject$ git init
